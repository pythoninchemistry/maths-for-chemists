    "# Partial Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we encounter quantities that depend on more than one variable. \n",
    "For example, the enthalpy, $H$, of a system depends on the pressure, $p$, and temperature, $T$. \n",
    "Another case is the ideal gas equation, as seen below: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure, $p$, of a gas depends on its volume, $V$, and the temperature, $T$, it is at. \n",
    "We often find it useful to calculate how one variable changes with another, while the remaining variables are seen to be constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recell, we can use the notation $y=f(x, z)$ to mean that $y$ is a function of $x$ and $z$, where $x$ and $z$ are independent variables. \n",
    "For example: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "y = x^2+zx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use partial derivatives to differentiate functions with multiple variables. \n",
    "We do this by differentiating with respect to one variable and treating all other variables as constants. \n",
    "So for $y=f(x, z)$, the partial derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is denoted: \n",
    "\n",
