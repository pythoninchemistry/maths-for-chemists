    "    This produces a new quantity. \n",
    "- Although we have used the notation $f(x)$, there is no reason why we could not use $g(x)$ or even $\\phi(x)$. \n",
    "- We can also have $f(x)$ or $f(\\theta)$ if we have functions *made up* of variables other than $x$. \n",

    "    Subtract 2 then gives us 4. \n",
    "    So our final answer it $f(3)=4$. \n",
    "2. We do these same steps but with the variable $x$ instead of a number. \n",
    "    First we double it to give $2x$. \n",
    "    Then we subtract 2 to give $2x-2$. \n",
    "    We now have that $f(x) = 2x-2$. \n",
