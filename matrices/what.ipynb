    "# What is a Matrix? \n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is defined as an array of numbers, such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "3 & 1 & 8 \\\\\n",
    "0 & -4 & 5\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matrices come in different sizes. We write the size of the matrix as rows&times;columns. \n",
    "    So the matrix above is 2&times;3 matrix. \n",
    "- We use capital letters such as $A$ or $B$ to denote matrices. \n",
    "- The numbers contained in a matrix are known as matrix elements. \n",
    "    They are denoted $x_{ij}$, where $i$ represents the row and $j$ the column in which the element is in the matrix $X$. \n",
    "    For example, in the above matrix $a_{11} = 3$ and $a_{23}=5$. \n",
    "- Matrices with an equal number of rows and columns are called square matrices.\n",
    "    For example, the 2&times;2 matrix below: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    1 & -1 \\\\ \n",

    "3. $C = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Solution:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The matrix $A$ has 4 rows and 3 columns, hence this is a $4\\times 3$ matrix. \n",
    "    We have that $a_{21} = 1$ and $a_{33}=6$. \n",
    "2. The matrix $B$ has 3 rows and 1 column, hence this is a $3\\times 1$ matrix. \n",
    "    We have that $b_{21}=-1$ and $b_{33}$ does not exist, as this is a $3\\times 1$ matrix. \n",
    "3. The matrix $C$ has 3 rows and 3 columns, hence it is a $3\\times 3$ matrix (also a square matrix). \n",
    "    We then have at $c_{21}=d$ and $c_{33}=i$. \n",
