    "ax^2 + bx + c\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. \n",
    "It is called a quadratic because it contains terms of $x$ up to and including $x^2$. \n",

    "We have a method called **FOIL** for expanding quadratic equations in the above form, so that they appear in the form $ax^2+bx+c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**FOIL** stands for **F**irst, **O**uter, **I**nner, and **L**ast and tells us which terms to take the product of. \n",
    "In the general case $(x+A)(x+B)$ **FOIL** works as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **F**irst terms will be the $x$s since they are both first in their brackets. \n",
    "2. The **O**uter terms will be $x$ and $B$ because they are on the outer side (nearest to the edges). \n",
    "3. The **I**nner terms are $A$ and the other $x$ as they are on the inner. \n",
    "4. The **L**ast terms are $A$ and $B$ because these are last in their brackets. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then expand our quadratic $(x+A)(x+B)$ as shown below.\n",
