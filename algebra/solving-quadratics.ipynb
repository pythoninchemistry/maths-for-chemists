    "Solving a quadratic equation involves finding all possible values of $x$ that satify $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. \n",
    "The values of $x$ that satify this equation are called the roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not that when $a=0$, the quadratic equation reduces to a simple linear equation $bx+c=0$, which is easy to solve. \n",
    "Also when $a\\neq 0$, we can divide through by $a$ to get an equivalent equation of the form $x^2+bx+c=0$. \n",

    "When a quadratic is in the form $x^2 + 2bx + b^2$, it is known as a perfect square, because it can be faactorised into a squared linear term $(x+b)^2$. \n",

    "$$\n",

    "Finally, since $b=-4$ is negative, the sum $A+B$ is negative and this forces us to chose $A=-5$ and $B=1$, giving us $x^2-4x -5 = (x-5)(x+1)$. \n",
