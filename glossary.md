Argand diagram
    A plot that represents complex numbers as points or vectors in a plane, with the horizontal axis showing the real part and the vertical axis showing the imaginary part.

dimensional analysis
    Dimensional analysis is the method of examining the relationships between physical quantities by identifying their fundamental dimensions (such as mass, length, time, charge, etc.) and units of measurement, in order to check the consistency of equations, derive scaling laws, or reduce the number of variables in a problem.

machine precision
    Machine precision is the smallest difference between two distinct floating-point numbers that a computer can represent.
