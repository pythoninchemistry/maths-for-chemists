    "\n",

    "\\int 2x\\;dx = x^2+C\n",

    "\n",
    "- The $\\int$ tells us we need to integrate. \n",
    "- The $dx$ tells us to integrate with respect to $x$. \n",
    "    So we could write $\\int 2z\\;dz = z^2 + C$, but in this case we have integrated with respect to $z$. \n",
    "- We call $\\int 2x\\;dx = x^2+C$ the integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another notation often used is the following, if we have the function $f(x)$, then we write this integrated as $F(x)$. \n",
    "So if $f(x) = 2x$, then $F(x) = x^2+C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integration finds the area under the curve. \n",
    "So if we want to find the area between two points (called *limits*) on the $x$-axis, say $a$ and $b$, we use the following notation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int^a_b = f(x)\\;dx\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us we want to find the integral of $f(x)$ and then use that information to find the area under the curve between $a$ and $b$. \n",
    "We find this area using the formula below: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int^a_b = f(x)\\;dx = F(b) - F(a)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "This is explained in detail in the section on [definite integrals](./int-with-limits.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "- When we are given limits, then we have a definite integral. \n",
    "- When we are not given limits, then we have an indefinite integral. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules for Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can split integrals over a sum. \n",
    "    For example \n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\int (x^2+2x+7)\\;dx = \\int x^3\\;dx + \\int 2x\\;dx + \\int 7\\;dx\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "2. We can take constants out of the integral. \n",
    "    For example\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\int 6x^4 \\;dx = 6\\int x^4\\;dx\n",
