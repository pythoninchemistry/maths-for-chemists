# Maths for Chemists

Welcome to Maths for Chemistry (*feat.* Python). 
This is Jupyter Book is an open-source, redevelopment of the [Maths for Chemists](https://edu.rsc.org/download?ac=15395) booklet that was originally prepared by Allan Cunningham and Rory Whelan (supported by Michael Grove, Joe Kyle, and Samantha Pugh). 

The majority of the text and chemistry examples are drawn, with permission, directly from this previous resource. 
However, in this version, the text and example have been adapted to include presentations of how the results are obtained using Python code. 
We hope that this will facilitate chemistry students that have *some* understanding of programming to get a better understanding of the mathematics necessary for chemistry. 

This Jupyter Book is an open-source project, developed on Github. 
This material is a *living book* and, therefore, may diverge from the source material overtime. 
If you would like to contribute to this book, perhaps by transcribing a section from the original source, please do so by opening a pull request on the [Github repository](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/maths-for-chemists), adding yourself to the contributors list below.
This project is led by [Andrew R. McCluskey](https://scams-research.github.io) (University of Bristol) and [Alan M. Lewis](https://www.york.ac.uk/chemistry/people/alan-lewis/) (University of York).
